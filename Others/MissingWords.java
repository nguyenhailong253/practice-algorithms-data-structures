/**
 * Given two strings, one is a subsequence if all of the elements of the first
 * string occur in the same order within the second string. They do not have to
 * be continguous in the second string, but order must be maintained. For
 * example, given the string 'I like cheese', the words ("I", "cheese") are one
 * possible subsequence of that string. Words are space delimited
 * 
 * Given two strings, s and t, where t is a subsequence of s, report the words
 * of s, missing in t (case sensitive), in the order they are missing.
 * 
 * Example s = "I like cheese", t = "like". Then "like" is the subsequence and
 * ["I", "cheese"] is the list of missing words, in order.
